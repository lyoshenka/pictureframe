# Dropbox Slideshow/Pictureframe

## Try It

[Demo here](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/n85zew5dx8yvmra/pictureframe/public/index.html).

## Hack It

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/getting_started.md#Initialization) to set up your own app. You only need the part under **Initialization**, but you may want to set up a "Powered by Dropbox" static app while you're at it. Once you're set up, replace my app key with your own at the top of pictureframe.js.
